# Data Structures Assignments
Assignments made as part of the data structures course at IIT. Assignments 1 and 2 simulate how mobile phones call each other. The main data structure used is trees. The process of the dialer connecting to its local tower and the call then being forwarded to the main parent tower to the signal finally reaching the dialee is simulated.

Assignments 3 and 4 implement a small search engine based on hash maps.
